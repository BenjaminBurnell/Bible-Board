## Sharing & Disclosure
We may share personal information with:

- **Legal/Compliance** recipients when required by law or to protect rights, safety, or property.
- **Business transfers** (e.g., merger/acquisition). If ownership or uses of your data change, we will notify you.

We **do not sell** personal information.

## International Transfers
Your information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your own. We take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards (e.g., contractual clauses) for cross-border transfers where required.

## Retention
We retain information for as long as necessary to provide the Service and for legitimate business or legal purposes. You may delete boards/content at any time from your account. We may retain limited logs for security and auditing for a reasonable period.

Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or port your data, and to object to or restrict certain processing. To exercise rights, email **benburnell.git@gmail.com**. We will verify your request and respond in accordance with applicable laws.

## Children’s Privacy
The Service is not directed to children under **13**.

Parents/guardians may contact us at **benburnell.git@gmail.com**.

## Security
We use technical and organizational measures appropriate to the risk, including encryption in transit (HTTPS), access controls, and periodic reviews. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## Cookies & Similar Technologies
We use essential cookies/local storage for login and preferences. If we add analytics or marketing cookies in the future, we will obtain consent where required and provide controls.

## Third-Party Content & APIs
Third parties that provide APIs or content (e.g., Bible texts, interlinear data, Apple iTunes Search) may process your data under their own policies. We are not responsible for third-party practices.
