## 1) Who we are
“BibleBoard”, “we”, “us”, or “our” provides a web application at **bibleboard.ca** for creating and arranging Bible-related notes, verses, and other content on a visual board (the “Service”).  
**Operator:** Sole proprietor (individual) currently using the project name “BibleBoard.”  
**Contact:** **benburnell.git@gmail.com**  
**Mailing location:** Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

## 2) Agreement to Terms
By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are using the Service on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization.

## 3) Eligibility
You must be **13+** (or the higher digital consent age in your region) to use the Service. If you are under the age of majority in your province/state, you may only use the Service with involvement of a parent/guardian. You may not use the Service if you are barred under applicable laws or under any prior suspension or removal.

## 4) Accounts & Security
You are responsible for keeping your credentials confidential and for all activity under your account. Notify us promptly of any unauthorized use or suspected breach.

## 5) Acceptable Use
You agree not to, and will not permit others to:
- violate laws or third-party rights (including intellectual property, privacy, and publicity);
- upload, post, or share content that is unlawful, defamatory, hateful, harassing, violent, sexually explicit, misleading, or otherwise objectionable;
- scrape, reverse engineer, overload, disrupt, or circumvent security/usage controls;
- upload malware or harmful code;
- provide professional advice (e.g., legal, medical, counseling) or claim authoritative, error-free translations or interpretations of Scripture using the Service.

We may remove or restrict content or accounts that violate these Terms or our policies.

## 6) User Content & License
You retain ownership of content you upload, post, or create (“User Content”). You grant BibleBoard a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, store, transmit, display, and otherwise use your User Content solely to operate, provide, and improve the Service and as otherwise permitted by your visibility settings (e.g., when you mark boards public).  
If a board is **public**, you grant other users a non-exclusive license to view it within the Service. You can switch visibility to private at any time, but previously accessed public content may have been cached or shared by others.

You are responsible for your User Content and for obtaining all necessary rights and permissions to post it.

## 7) BibleBoard IP
The Service’s software, interfaces, designs, logos, and the content we provide (excluding User Content and third-party content) are owned by BibleBoard and its licensors and are protected by intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the Service unless we give you written permission.

## 8) Third-Party Content & Services
The Service may display or integrate third-party content and link to third-party services (e.g., Bible texts, interlinear/lexicon data, Apple iTunes Search API, Supabase, Render, AllOrigins). We do not control and are not responsible for third-party content/services. Your use of them is governed by their own terms and privacy policies.

## 9) No Professional Advice; Scripture Disclaimer
BibleBoard is for informational/devotional purposes only and is **not** a substitute for professional advice (pastoral, counseling, medical, legal, financial, etc.). Bible texts, translations, interlinear tokens, lexicons, and related materials may contain errors or inconsistencies. BibleBoard does not warrant theological correctness or completeness.

## 10) Feedback
If you provide feedback or suggestions, you grant us a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use them without restriction.

## 11) Paid Features & Subscriptions (if any)
If you purchase paid features, you agree to the pricing and billing terms presented at checkout. Fees are non-refundable unless required by law. Taxes may apply. We may change prices upon notice.

## 12) Changes to the Service
We may modify or discontinue the Service (in whole or in part) at any time, with or without notice, subject to applicable law.

## 13) Termination
You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate access immediately if you breach these Terms, if required by law, or to protect the Service or users. Upon termination, sections that by their nature should survive (e.g., IP, disclaimers, limitations of liability, indemnity, dispute resolution) will survive.

## 14) Warranty Disclaimers
THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, BIBLEBOARD AND ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT CONTENT WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE.

## 15) Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, BIBLEBOARD AND ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AND SUPPLIERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICE WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO BIBLEBOARD IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM AROSE OR (B) **CAD $100**.

## 16) Indemnification
You will indemnify and hold harmless BibleBoard and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or relating to your User Content, your use of the Service, or your violation of these Terms or applicable law.

## 17) Dispute Resolution; Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of the **Province of Ontario** and the laws of **Canada** applicable therein, without regard to conflicts of law. **Venue** shall be the courts located in **Toronto, Ontario**. (If arbitration is preferred in future, this clause may be replaced with a binding arbitration clause compliant with Ontario law.)

## 18) Export & Sanctions
You represent that you are not located in a country or on a list subject to Canadian, U.S., or other applicable sanctions, and you will not use the Service in violation of export control or sanctions laws.

## 19) Changes to Terms
